# Introduction

*Data* is everywhere, and *football* is not an exception. From most basic statistics, as leagues' rankings, to more advanced, as players' position and event tracking. 


There are some specific *R libraries* around football (or *soccer*). 
First, I chose *Statsbomb* as data source because their library (**StatsBombR**) provides access to a collection of free advanced data. This is the main reason for this choice between different providers.

Also, *soccermatics* is a very useful (<u>*open source*</u>) library that encapsulates both data transformations and data visualizations. It is the base of the book of the same name, written by *David Sumpter*, that is very helpful to introduce and understand football analytics.  


This *Exploratory Data Analysis* also uses other very popular libraries for data analytics as *dplyr* and *ggplot*.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(StatsBombR)
library(soccermatics)
# Data manipulation
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(scales)
# Plotting data
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(rmarkdown)
library(knitr)
```
