# The dataset(s)
## Competitions
*Statsbomb* package provides different types of data. First, we can see all available competitions:
```{r}
all_competitions = FreeCompetitions()

paged_table(head(all_competitions))
```

```{r}
count_countries = length(unique(all_competitions$country_name))
count_names = length(unique(all_competitions$competition_name))
count_season = length(all_competitions$season_name)
paste("Different Countries:", count_countries, " -- Different Competitions:", count_names, " -- Total Comp Seasons:", count_season)
```

All female leagues available are the following:
```{r}
fem_leagues = all_competitions %>%
  filter(all_competitions$competition_gender == "female")
kable(fem_leagues %>%
  select(c(competition_name, season_name)))
```
